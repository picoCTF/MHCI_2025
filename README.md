# MHCI_2025
Work from the 2025 MHCI team: Melissa Gibney, Sanjna Subramanian, Lok Hang Hedy Hui, Megan Chai, and Zoe Mercado

Melissa Gibney wrote the majority of the code for this project, while the rest of the team designed the components. Ivan Liang contributed the Caddyfile and helped to set up integration with an internal Kepler server. The components designed by the team can be found by opening the Storybook session and navigating to the Figma tab for each component.

Please note that this repository contains future designs and ideas, so they will not be released immediately.
